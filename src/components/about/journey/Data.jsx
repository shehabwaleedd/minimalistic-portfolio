I was responsible for making sure that the foreigner is having a great time in Egypt and that he is enjoying his stay, I was also responsible for making sure that the foreigner is safe and that he is not getting into any trouble. In this experience I have learnt how to deal with people from different cultures and backgrounds and it literally widened my horizions and made me a more of a global citizen."

I am also responsible for making sure that the guests are having a great time and that they are enjoying their stay in Cairo. Been a superhost for 3 consecutive months and having multiple 5 star reviews is a great achievement for me. For me it was not a job that I am just working, I was able to have a lot of friends who stayed in my place but as we have developed human interaction we have become friends and I am so glad to have met them."

And Wow. What A Journey So Far!"
